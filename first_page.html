                <h1>Environment</h1>
                <p>Environment variables play a crucial role in configuring applications for different environments such as development, testing, staging, and production. They are variables whose values are set outside the code or application, influencing the program's functionality. Commonly used for setting up different configuration options across programming environments, environment variables also serve as a secure means to store sensitive information like API keys and authentication tokens, keeping them away from the public domain. This approach enhances code predictability by maintaining configuration outside the main codebase.</p>
